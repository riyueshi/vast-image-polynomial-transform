# Introduction
The purpose of this code is to solve huge image which can not simply read in memory at once. Both polynomial transform and affine transform has been provide, and you can also to write you own transform.   

##dependence
[opencv](http://opencv.org/)   
[GDAL](http://www.gdal.org/)   
##infomation
This code is tested with opencv 2.4.3 and GDAL 1.9.   
if you want to use this code to solve vast image you'd better to build a 64 bit program.    
It would be great if this code can help you solve you problem. And you may star this repository let me know, thanks.
